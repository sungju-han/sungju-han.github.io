## About Sungju

I am a doctoral researcher at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ and the University of Potsdam. My research interests include sustainable flood risk management using nature-based solutions (NBS) and the people's perceptions within the context.

My Ph.D. project investigates flood risk and perceptions of the exposed communities on Nature-based solutions (NBS) as alternatives of conventional measures such as damming or diking, and how different constructs such as valuation of multiple other benefits like aesthetical value or biodiversity, evaluation of risk reduction efficacy influence the perceptions. 

I am interested in survey analysis in R and also data visualization. Still practicing!

Outside of work, I enjoy ballet, yoga, playing piano and, these days, cooking!
