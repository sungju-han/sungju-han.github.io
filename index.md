## About me

**Sungju Han** is a **_Ph.D researcher_** at the [UFZ](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=45349) and  University of Potsdam. 

My research interests include flood risk management using nature-based solutions (NBS), particularly people's perceptions. I work on my PhD project that explores the interplay of constructs surrounding the people's perception of NBS such as valuation of co-benefits, risk reduction efficacy, environmental attitudes, stakeholder participation and institutional trust.

Outside of work, I enjoy ballet, yoga, playing piano and, these days, cooking!
